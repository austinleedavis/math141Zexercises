Comparing average per-capita income (in $1000s) in metropolitan areas in 2016 and 1969. [Source: NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/13/opinion/inequality-cities-life-expectancy.html?referringSource=articleShare) Dark dots are 2016.


1. Find a city with 200,000 inhabitants
2. Why did the graph designers arrange the X-axis the way it is?
3. Looking at the light dots, that is, for 1969, write down a simple form of model relating the per-capita income to the population size. (Hint: Do you want logs or exponential functions of income.) You can use symbols for the parameters, but give a rough numerical value for each parameter.


```{r lamb-freeze-closet-1, echo = FALSE}

```

```{r lamb-freeze-closet-2, echo = FALSE}

```
