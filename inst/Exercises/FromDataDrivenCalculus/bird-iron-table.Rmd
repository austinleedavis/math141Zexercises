TITLE GOES HERE: Common function families and their parameters

1.  $m x + b$: slope and intercept
#.  $A sin( \frac{2\pi}{P} t ) + C$: amplitude A, period $P$, and vertical offset $C$. (There's also a phase, a starting point, a horizontal offset. But we won't worry about that right now.)
#.  Linear functions: parameterization $f(x,y) = a x + b y + c$ and contour plot (parallel lines)
#. Exponentials: time constant or
