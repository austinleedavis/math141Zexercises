```

TITLE GOES HERE: Consider the function of age and income implied by the table.


```{r bird-come-shoe-1, echo = FALSE}
f = function(x,y){2.5*(x-8)^2 + 1.5*(y-4)}
x = 0:12
y = 0:12
vals = outer(x,y,f)
inds = ceiling(50*rank(c(vals))/length(c(vals)))
foo = expand.grid(x,y)
colorSet = rainbow(80)
plot(1:10, xlim=range(x), ylim=range(y), xlab="age",ylab="income",type="n")
text(foo$Var1,foo$Var2, round(vals),cex=1, col=colorSet[inds])
```

* Draw contours at $0$, $30$, $60$, $90$, $120$, and $150$.
