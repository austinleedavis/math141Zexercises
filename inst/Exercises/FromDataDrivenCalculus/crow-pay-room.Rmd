TITLE GOES HERE: Interpreting contours: 

Interpret this map. Where's the tallest hill? Where is a valley?

Translating from simple knowledge of a function to a contour plot:

It's hard to draw a function of two variables from a verbal understanding of the function. Examples:

i. Car price depends on both age and mileage.
ii. The Ideal Gas Law says that pressure increases with temperature and decreases with volume. Plot out contours of pressure as a function of temperature and volume.
    a. Provide the graph. 
    b. Show the van der Waals gas law: $$(P + \frac{n^2 a}{V^2})(V-nb) = nr T$$

Highlight difference between a "graph" and a contour plot.
    -   The graph of a function of two variables will be a 2-d surface.
    -   DIGRESSION: What would contour plots of a function of one variable look like? (Isolated dots or regions on the single axis.)
