```{r camel-cost-roof-default, include = FALSE}
SDSdata::sds_setup()
```

TITLE GOES HERE: Using the data in the table, answer the questions about the implied function.


```{r camel-cost-roof-1, echo = FALSE}
f = function(x,y){3*(x-1)^2-2*(y-2)^2 + 20}
x = -6:6
y = seq(6,-6,by=-1)
vals = outer(x,y,f)
foo = expand.grid(x,y)
plot(1:10, xlim=range(x), ylim=range(y), xlab="x",ylab="y",type="n")
text(foo$Var1,foo$Var2, round(vals),cex=1)
```
 
1. What's the value $f( x=2, y=3)$?
#. What's the value $f( x=1, y=-3)$?
#. Draw contours at $-20$, $0$, $20$, $40$ and $60$.
