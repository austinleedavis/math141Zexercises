TITLE GOES HERE: Second derivatives and curvature

The "modes" of reading off the first and second derivative from a function: height, slope, curvature.

Exercise with identifying regions of positive and negative curvature and using those to help guide a sketch of a derivative.

Mnemonic for curvatureÂ : Smile = positive, Frown=negative

Use `mDerivs` to show a set of derivatives. changes -- keep a consistent color scheme for the functions: black=f, blue=df, red=ddf, yellow=integral.

Exercise with sorting out the order of derivatives from graphs.
