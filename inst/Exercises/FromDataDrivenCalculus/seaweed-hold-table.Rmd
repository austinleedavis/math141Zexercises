TITLE GOES HERE: Area and Circumference of a Circle

Do dimensional analysis to see that the area of a circle must be something proportional to $r^2$ or to $r c$, where $c$ is the circumference.

No particular reason to think that the constants of proportionality need to be the same. Yet they are so closely related: area is $\pi r^2$ and circumference is $2 \pi r$.

Argument that the circumference is the change in the area as $r$ changes.
