TITLE GOES HERE: Give a table of values, perhaps BMI. Which does BMI depend more on, weight or height?

How would you go about answering this question? What things are ambiguous about the question itself? 

What constitutes a "change in height?" Should we look at a percentage change, e.g. 2" is about 4.1% of 6'? Should we look at a z-score change?

Find sd of height. Is sd of weight as meaningful, or should it be sd of weight at a particular height?
