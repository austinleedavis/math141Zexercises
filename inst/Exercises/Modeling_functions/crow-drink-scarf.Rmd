TITLE GOES HERE: Data and body mass index

Use the data from Quetelet (from p. 707 of [PPN129323640_0007.pdf](https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN129323640_0007?tify={%22pages%22:[685],%22panX%22:0.552,%22panY%22:0.31,%22view%22:%22export%22,%22zoom%22:0.821}) which has a copy of "Les poids de l'homme ...")

Need to add in males to data



```{r crow-drink-scarf-2, echo = FALSE}
Females %>% mutate(
  ratio = poids/tailles,
  index = poids/(tailles^2)
) %>%
  gf_point(data = ., ratio ~ ages) %>%
  gf_point(index ~ ages, color = "blue")
```


1. How do you think a BMI range of 20-25 came to be considered "normal?"
2. What advantages, if any, does the BMI index have when compared to the simple ratio of weight to height?
3. What happens when we look at the maximum and minimum of weight and height? Do we see that the index is more stable than the ratio?

Remember, mean was considered as "ideal," and statistics were regarded as reliable only for populations, not on individuals. Today, we'd like to have age, height, weight for individuals

```{r crow-drink-scarf-3, echo = FALSE}
library(NHANES)
Tmp <- 
  NHANES %>% 
  mutate(
    ratio = Weight / Height,
    index = 703 * Weight / (Height^2), # try also height^3
    kid = Age < 20
  ) 
    gf_point(data = Tmp, ratio ~ Age, color = ~ Gender, alpha = 0.1) %>% 
      gf_smooth()
  gf_point(data = Tmp, index ~ Age, color = ~ Gender, alpha = 0.1) %>% gf_smooth()
  
  gf_point(data = Tmp, index ~ ratio | Gender, color = ~ kid, alpha = 0.1) %>%
    gf_smooth()
```

USE COMPARISON of height^2 to height^3 graphics as a way of distinguishing between two 

USE THIS FOR LOCALLY LINEAR
