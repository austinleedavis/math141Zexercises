Fluctuating humidity in museum exhibition halls is a serious problem. It leads to degradation of valuable and irreplaceable artifacts.  The goal is to install a climate control system that maintains constant humidity.   The figure displays humidity records for two years at one of the world's great natural history museums.  Each  black rectangle shows fluctuation during a week.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

1. Write a paragraph to the museum Director summarizing in words the data shown in the graph.  Suggest an explanation for the data. 
#. Find a mathematical model that captures the most important features of the data.  Define clearly all variables that you use, including their units.
