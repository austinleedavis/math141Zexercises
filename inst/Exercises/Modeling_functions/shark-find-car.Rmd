`r etude::exercise_title()`   Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) famously offered three Laws of Planetary Motion. The third states: the average distance of a planet from the Sun cubed is directly proportional to the orbital period squared. 

1.  Convert this  Law into the notation we are  using  for functions to define P(D),  the period of the planet P as a function of the average distance from the Sun D. 
2. Which form of  the modeling  functions  we have  studied is P(D)? 
3.  Suppose you had a  data  frame with two variables for  each planet:  D and  P. Describe what kind of  plot you would  make and  what you  would  expect  the planet  data to look given that Kepler's Third Law holds.
