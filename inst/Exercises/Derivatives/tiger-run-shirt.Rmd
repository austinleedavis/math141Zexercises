`r etude::exercise_title()`   The graphs on the left side of the table give some function $f(x,y)$. For each of the graphs, say whether the graph on the right side of the table gives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ or $\frac{\partial   f}{\partial y}$.  (You just need to write down which one it is, not do any detailed calculation.)


$f( x, y )$ |  Is it $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ or $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$
