`r etude::exercise_title()`  Here is a second-order polynomial in two variables, $x$ and $y$:
$$ p(x,y) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 x y + a_4 x^2 + a_5 y^2  .$$

Write down each of the following derivatives:

a.  ${\partial p}/{\partial x}$

#. ${\partial p}/{\partial y}$

#. ${\partial^2 p}/{\partial x^2}$

#. ${\partial^2 p}/{\partial y^2}$

#. ${\partial^2 p}/{\partial x \partial y}$ (First w.r.t. $y$, then w.r.t. $x$)

#. ${\partial^2 p}/{\partial x \partial y}$ (First w.r.t. $x$, then w.r.t. $y$)

#.  Which of the above derivatives relates most clearly and plainly to the interaction term?
