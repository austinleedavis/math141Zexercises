1. Estimate a number for the derivative of the function $f(x,y)$ at the indicated point:

    a. $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ at A.
    #. $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ at B.
    #. $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ at A.
    #. $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ at B.

#. Mark a point on the graph where both  $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are very small in magnitude. Label the point with "small."
#. Mark a point on the graph where both  $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are very big in magnitude. Label the point with "big."
