# Question 1

The derivative of a function is negative everywhere on the interval $x=2$ to $x=3$.  Where on this interval does the function have its maximum value?

a. At $x=2$
#. At $x=3$
#. Somewhere between $x=2$ and $x=3$.
#. It does not have a maximum, since the derivative is never zero.
#. We cannot tell if it has a maximum since we don't know where the second derivative is negative.


# Question 2


The duration of daylight $L$ in minutes (sunrise to sunset), $x$ kilometers north of latitude 40 is given by the function $L = f(x)$.  What are the units of the second derivative $f\ '\ '(x)$?

a. kilometers per minute
#. minutes per kilometer
#. kilometers per minute$^2$
#. minutes per kilometer$^2$
#. minutes$^2$ per kilometer$^2$


# Question 3

The figure shows the graph of a function $f(x)$.

# Question 4

<!-- Author: Calculus Concept Inventory, Form 5 - August, 2006 -->

Let $f$ be the function defined by $f(x) = x + 2$.  Let $g$ be the function $g(u) = u + 2$.  Then which of the following is true?

a. $f$ and $g$ are exactly the same function.
#. $f$ and $g$ are different functions because $x$ and $u$ are different variables.
#. $f$ and $g$ are different functions whenever $x$ and $u$ are different numbers.
#. Not enough information is given to determine if $f$ and $g$ are the same function.

# Question 5

<!-- Author: Calculus Concept Inventory, Form 5 - August, 2006 -->
As water is drained out of a bathtub, the volume of water $V$ and its depth in the tub $h$ change with time $t$.

Which of the following is true of $\frac{dV}{dh}$ and $\frac{dV}{dt}$?

a. They must be equal.
#. They must have opposite signs.
#. They must be negative.
#. Both must be positive.
#. None of these.


# Question 6

<!-- Author: Calculus Concept Inventory, Form 5 - August, 2006 -->

The derivative $f\ '(x)$ of function $f(x)$ is negative everywhere.  We also know that $f(0) = 0$.  What must be true about $f(-1)$?

a. $f(-1)$ is negative.
#. $f(-1)$ is positive.
#. $f(-1)$ is zero.
#. Not enough information to conclude anything about $f(-1)$.


# Question 7

<!-- Author: Calculus Concept Inventory, Form 5 - August, 2006 --> 

Yesterday's temperature at $t$ hours past midnight was $T(t)$ degrees F.  At noon, the temperature was $5$ deg F.  The first derivative $T\ '(t)$ reached a low of $+1$ degrees/hour at 6:00 am, then increased for the rest of day.  Which of the following is correct?

a. Temperature fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon.
#. At 1pm, the temperature was $6$ deg F.
#. At 1pm, the temperature was $4$ deg F.
#. The temperature was lower at 6:00 am than at any other time.
#. The temperature rose all day.


# Question 8

A graph of a moving object's velocity against time is shown.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/cci-D-accel.png")
```

The acceleration of the object is which of the following?

a. Positive everywhere
#. Negative everywhere
#. Zero everywhere
#. Zero at some times but not others
#. It cannot be determined from the given information. 

# Question 9

The function $f(x)$ has derivative $f\ '(x)$.  Which of the following is an equation for a line that is tangent to $f(x)$ at a point $x_0$?

a. $f(x_0) + f\ '(x)$
#.  $f(x_0) + f\ '(x_0)$
#.  $f(x_0) + f\ '(x_0) x$
#.  $f(x_0) + f\ '(x_0) (x-x_0)$
#. None of the above.

# Question 10

<!-- Author: Calculus Concept Inventory, Form 5 - August, 2006 -->

If a function is always positive, what must be true about its derivative?

a. The derivative is always positive.
#. The derivative is never negative.
#. The derivative is increasing.
#. The derivative is decreasing.
#. You can't conclude anything about the derivative. 

# Question 11

```{r one, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Pts <- tibble::tibble(
  x = c(3.2,4,-1,-3,-1.5),
  y = c(1,3.5,-4, 1.5,-2),
  label = c("M","N","O","P","S")
)
f = rfun( seed=79923 )
graphFun(f(lat, long) ~ lat + long, 
         latlim=c(-5,5), longlim=c(-5,5), tile=FALSE) %>%
  gf_text(y ~ x, label = ~ label, data = Pts, inherit=FALSE)
```
 
1. Draw the gradient of the function at points M, N, O, and P.
2. Water flows downhill.  Assuming that the graph reflects the elevation of a surface on which water can flow, draw a plausible path for water flowing out of a spring located at point S.


# Question 12

A function $f(x,y)$ has partial derivatives $\partial f/\partial x$ and $\partial f / \partial y$.  At point $x=0, y=0$, the partial $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} (0,0) > 0$.  You also know that on the rectangle $x$ in $0$ to $1$ and $y$ in $0$ to $1$, the second derivatives $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} > 0$
and $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} > 0$.


1. What can you say about the value $f(1,0)$?
    a. It must be the same as $f(0,0)$.
    #. It must be greater than $f(0,0)$.
    #. It must be less than $f(0,0)$.
    #. No such definite statement can be made.

2. What can you say about the value $f(0,1)$?
    a. It must be the same as $f(0,0)$.
    #. It must be greater than $f(0,0)$.
    #. It must be less than $f(0,0)$.
    #. No such definite statement can be made.

3. What can you say about the value $f(1,1)$?
    a. It must be the same as $f(0,0)$.
    #. It must be greater than $f(0,0)$.
    #. It must be less than $f(0,0)$.
    #. No such definite statement can be made.

# Question 13

A function $f(x,y)$ is defined on the rectangular region $x$ in $(0,2)$ and $y$ in $(0,4)$.  The partial derivatives $\partial f / \partial x$  and $\partial f / \partial y$ are positive everywhere in the rectangular region.

What can you say about the location of the maximum value of $f(x,y)$ in the region?

a. It must be at the point $x =0, y=0$.
#. It must be at the point $x= 2, y=4$.
#. It can be anywhere along the border $x=0$.
#. It can be anywhere along the border $x=2$.
#. It can be anywhere in the rectangular region.
