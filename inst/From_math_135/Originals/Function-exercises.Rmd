# Exercise 23: Insurance

Insurance is a mechanism for sharing risks.  It provides a way for people to pay out a relatively small amount on a steady basis --- the "premium" --- in exchange for a promise that there will be compensation in the event of some unlikely but very harmful event.  The amount of compensation is called the "coverage."

The following table is part of an advertisement from the American Association of
Retired Persons (AARP) offering life insurance.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(
  system.file("images/aarp-rates.png", 
              package = "math141Zexercises")
)
```

The premiums are different for men and women and for different ages.
For instance, a woman aged 62 pays $20.44 per month for a
coverage of $10,000, while a man of age 62 pays somewhat more $24.85.

In this exercise, you are going to build a simple general model of the insurance premium and then examine the residuals to explore what story is told by the details of the variations across age and sex. Among the questions that the table might prompt are these: 

- The premiums are neither round numbers nor the typical 99-cent
  ending.  They suggest precision in the means by which the rate is
  calculated.  Is this justified?
- There is a difference between men and women.  Why?
- Although there is insurance coverage available for people 75-79
  years old, this is not listed in the table.  Why not?
- The 45-49 year category is available only to people married to
  an AARP member 50 years and older.  Other categories apply to any
  AARP member.  Does this influence the price for the 45-49 year category?


Consider each of the above questions and write down any hypothesis you
might have.  

THEORY OF LIFE INSURANCE.

Life insurance is a way to reduce the risk of loss of income or
services in case of death.  The usual setting is that a wage earner
buys insurance so that, in the event of the wage earner's death, his
or her family will  receive an amount of money that can be used to
offset the lost wages.  

One way to think about insurance is in terms of probabilities.  From the insurance company's point of view, the cost of the insurance is the amount of the coverage times the probability of the adverse event.  For example, if a person's chance of dying in one year is 0.01, and the coverage is $50,000, then this person will, on averge, cost the insurance company $0.01 \times \$50000 = \$500$ per year.   A sensible insurance company will charge a premium that is somewhat more than they expect to pay out, to cover their administrative and marketing costs and provide a profit. 

Another perspective is that of the market.  A person might reasonably value the risk mitigation from insurance at a higher amount than the cost of providing that risk mitigation.  Insurance companies can charge what the market will bear, rather than charging exactly their costs.

In this exercise, you are going to explore the relationship between the premium and coverage for life insurance and the risk of dying. Here's an advertisement for life insurance from the American Association of Retired People (AARP) published in March 2012.  The data are organized into a spreadsheet in the file `"AARP-insurance.csv"`:
```{r }
aarp = read.csv("http://www.mosaic-web.org/datasets/AARP-insurance.csv")
```
 

Insurance companies don't like to talk about the risk of dying --- bad karma, perhaps --- but the Social Security Administration collects this information and publishes it in the form of age- and sex-specific mortality rates: the probability of a person of a given age and sex dying in the next year.  One such table constructed for year 2007 is available at <http://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html>.  The data on mortality have been re-organized in the file `"LifeExpectancy.csv"`:
```{r }
mortality <- read.csv("http://www.mosaic-web.org/datasets/LifeExpectancy.csv")
```

1. Plot `Mortality` versus `Age` from the   life-expectancy data.  Make sure that you understand the overall   pattern.  In particular, what happens to mortality between ages 45   and 75?  Note that there is a difference between the sexes; at any   given age, the mortality for women is less than that for men. 

#. Plot `Cost` versus `Coverage` from the AARP data. What feature in this plot illustrates the different mortality rates   at different ages? 

The AARP breaks down its rates according to age and sex.  This is reasonable because mortality depends on age and sex.

You're going to reverse engineer the AARP rates to take advantage what you know about mortality rates from the Social Security Administration.  
 
The first step is to combine the AARP and mortality data into one table, to enter the mortality rate that corresponds to each sex and age combination.  This can be done by "merging" the two tables.  You could do this by hand: look up mortality for each age/sex combination and enter it into the table.  But it's easiest to let the software do it for you:
```{r }
both = merge( aarp, mortality )
```
 
Clearly, the cost of the insurance should depend on both the mortality rate and the coverage

```{r document_d92c4db-QA1, echo=FALSE}
# indicate correct choices with +_+ in the name of the list item.
etude::choose_one(
  prompt = "Which of these letters is a vowel?",
  choices = list(
    "+A+" = "",
    "B" = "B's a consonant, Bub.",
    "C" = "C is a consonant, Chub",
    "D" = "D is a consonant, Dear",
    "+E+" = ""
  )
)
```






# Problem 29

TURN THIS INTO SEVERAL PROBLEMS

1. Why we need parameters A and B.
2. What happens if we get the period wrong, way 1.3
3. Is the shift important? Figure out the shift using `fitModel()`  and then explain why the shift found makes sense climatologically.
4. Does the `bottom_clip()` function help? Does squaring the sine help? How about an absolute value of sin together with a period of 2 years?
5. Fit `ccf ~ temp` and then use temp to predict the ccf usage.
6. Calculate month by month errors, then use these to set a prediction error.
7. Strip out the year, duplicate to be two periods long, get a smoother to represent the middle year of the two-year duplicate, then a wrapper to add the year on so that you can graph the time series for a long span of years.

The `mosaicData/Utilities` data frame has records of the use of electricity and natural gas by a family.  Let's look at natural gas use as a function of time.

```{r nat-gas-v-time}
For_plotting  <-
  mosaicData::Utilities %>%
  mutate(date = year + month/12 + day/30)
gf_line(ccf ~ date, data  = For_plotting)
```

For each of the following functional formulas, use `fitModel()` to find the appropriate parameters and plot the resulting model function along with the data.

1. `ccf ~ A * sin(2 * pi *  date / period)`
2. `ccf ~ A + sin(2 * pi *  date / period) + B`
3. `ccf ~ A + sin(2 * pi * (date - shift) / period) + B`
4. `ccf ~ A + sin(2 * pi * (date - shift) / 1) + B` 


```{r echo=FALSE}
bottom_clip <- function(x) {
  ifelse(x < 20, 20, x)
}

form1 <- ccf ~ A * sin(2  * pi * date / period)
form2 <- ccf ~ A * sin(2 * pi *  date / period) + B
form3 <- ccf ~ A * sin(2 * pi * (date-shift) / 1) + B
form4 <- ccf ~ bottom_clip((A * sin(2 * pi * (date - shift)) + B)^2)

model1 <- fitModel(form1, data=For_plotting)
model2 <- fitModel(form2, data = For_plotting, 
                   start = list(period=1, B=100, A=100))
model3 <- 
  fitModel(form3, data=For_plotting,
           start = list(B=100, A=100,  shift=0.25))
model4 <- 
  fitModel(form4, data=For_plotting,
           start = list(B=100, A=100,  shift=0.25))



gf_line(ccf ~ date, data  = For_plotting) %>%
  #gf_fun(model1(date) ~ date, color = "red") %>%
  gf_fun(model2(date) ~ date, color = "blue", lwd=1)  %>%
  gf_fun(model3(date) ~ date, color = "green", alpha = .5, lwd=2) %>%
  gf_fun(model4(date) ~ date, color = "orange", alpha = .5, lwd=3) %>%
  gf_lims(x = c(2002.5, 2006.5))
  
```

# Exercise 30

Natural gas is widely used for home heating in the United States.  The quantity in underground storage, which fluctuates, is tracked to help with long term planning.   The heavy line in the figure displays storage records in the United States for two consecutive years.  (The shaded region  represents the range between the maximum and minimum values during the longer period from 2003 through 2007.   You can ignore this part of the graph when doing the problem.) 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Natural gas storage  for two years in the lower 48 US states. [Source](http://www.321energy.com/editorials/mckenziebrown/mckenziebrown04 0808.html)."}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/naturalGasStorage.png")
```

1. Model the relationship between time of year and natural gas storage. Your model should capture the most important features of the data, but does not have to reflect every detail. Define clearly all variables that you use, including their units. 
2. Sketch on the graph (even if roughly) the relationship depicted by your model. Comment on the features of the real-world relationship that are not captured by your model.
3.  Write a paragraph for a news article summarizing in words the data shown in the graph.  Suggest an explanation for the data.

# Exercise 32



# Exercise 33

A decade ago, it was claimed by environmental activists that the world's capacity to generate energy from wind has been increasing exponentially. Evaluate that claim using data from British Petroleum's *Statistical Review of World Energy 2010*.  

Here is a table of numerical values of wind power capacity (in Gigawatts) for various years, a plot of that data, and a semilog plot of the data.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
Solar <- tribble(
  ~ year, ~ capacity,
  1995, 4778,
  1997, 7636,
  1999, 13932,
  2001, 24927,
  2003, 40301,
  2005, 59398,
  2007, 94005,
  2009, 160084
) %>%
  mutate(`log(capacity)` = round(log10(capacity),2),
         capacity = round(capacity/1000, 2))
SDSdata::sds_table(Solar, show_n=Inf, align="r")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="keep"}
gf_point(capacity ~ year, data = Solar) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1995, 2009, by=2))) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Capacity (GW)", title = "Linear scale")
gf_point(capacity ~ year, data = Solar) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_y_log10(breaks=c(1,2, 5,10, 20, 50, 100, 200)),
            scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1995, 2009, by=2))) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "", title = "Semi-log scale")
  

```

# Exercise 36

A debit card is a way to make withdrawals from a bank account.  Funds in the account earn interest, perhaps at 4% per year. But if the account is in debt, then the debt grows at a much faster rate, perhaps 15% per year.  

Suppose the amount in the bank account is $m$ (in dollars) and time is $t$ (in years).  If $m$ is positive, you are earning interest.  If negative, you are in debt and the debt will grow.


```{r paper,echo = FALSE}
make_paper <- function() graph_paper( xticks=seq(-1000,1000,by=200), 
            yticks=seq(-150,150,by=10), xlab="m (dollars)", ylab="dm/dt (dollars per year)")
```
 

```{r bank1,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
make_paper()
curve(0.04*x,0,1000,add=TRUE,col="blue", lwd=3)
curve(0.15*x,-1000,0,add=TRUE,col="blue", lwd=3)
```
 

```{r bank2,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
make_paper()
curve(-0.04*x,-1000,0,add=TRUE,col="blue", lwd=3)
curve(-0.15*x,0,1000,add=TRUE,col="blue", lwd=3)
```
 

```{r bank3,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
make_paper()
curve(-0.04*x,0,1000,add=TRUE,col="blue", lwd=3)
curve(-0.15*x,-1000,0,add=TRUE,col="blue", lwd=3)
```
 

```{r bank4,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
make_paper()
curve(0.04*x,-1000,0,add=TRUE,col="blue", lwd=3)
curve(0.15*x,0,1000,add=TRUE,col="blue", lwd=3)
```
  
1. Which of the following graphs reflects the dynamics of the system?

    ```{r one-two,echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Scenarios A and B"} 
knitr::include_graphics("/images/bank-bank1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/images/bank-bank2.png")
```

    ```{r three-four,echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Scenarios C and D"} 
knitr::include_graphics("/images/bank-bank3.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/images/bank-bank4.png")
```

2. On the graph paper below, sketch out the modifications of the   bank-card dynamics described. Identify any fixed points by marking them on the graph and say if they are stable or unstable.
  
    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="hold"} 
knitr::include_graphics("/images/bank-paper.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/images/bank-paper.png")
```

    a. In addition to the normal bank-card dynamics, your employer makes a steady retirement deposit into your account at the rate of $100 per year.      
    b. Your darling aunt looks at your account balance.  If you have less than $300 in your account, she will add money daily at a rate of $100 per year.  Otherwise, she does nothing.
    

# Exercise 38


# Exercise 39


"Wind chill" is a quantity used to describe how cold a person feels.  It takes into account both air temperature and the wind-speed. The figure shows Wind Chill as a function of air temperature and wind speed.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/wind-chil.png")
```

The following questions involve reading quantities off of the graph. In addition to giving the numerical answer called for, you should mark a point on the graph that is relevant to the answer you are giving. For each item, use the letter label for that item, e.g., (b), as your mark. 

1. What is the wind chill if the air temperature is $0^{\circ}$F and the wind speed is 10 mph?  Mark the relevant point on the graph with label "(a)" and give the numerical value (with units) of wind chill.

<!--begin-answer-->
The point on the graph with wind speed of 10 mpg and air temperature of 0 is just to the right of the $-20$ contour, between the $-20$ and $0$ contours.  So the wind chill is somewhere between $-20$ and $0$. Since the point is about one-quarter of the way from the $-20$ contour $0$ contour, it's reasonable to conclude that the wind chill is about one-quarter of the way between $-20$ and $0$, that is, $-15$.
<!--end-answer-->

#. Bare skin is at risk of frostbite in just a few minutes when the wind chill is below $-50^{\circ}$F.  If the air temperature is $-20^\circ$F, what is the wind speed at which the wind chill is $-50^{\circ}$? Mark the point on the relevant point on the graph with label "(b)" and give the numerical value of wind speed.

<!--begin-answer-->
The contour labeled "-40" tells all the combinations of wind speed and air temperature where the wind chill is $-40$.  To answer this question, you need a contour labelled "-50."  No such contour has been drawn on the graph but it's reasonable to assume that it is going to be mid-way between the "-60" and the "-40" contours.  Sketch in that contour and look for the wind speed where the contour crosses the line for air temperature of $-20^\circ$.
<!--end-answer-->

#. Find a point where the wind speed produces a wind chill 20 degrees colder than   the air temperature?  Mark it clearly on the graph with the label  "(c)".  



<!--begin-answer-->
This will be the wind speed at which a given contour line crosses the vertical line with the value 20 degrees less.  For instance, there is a wind-chill contour labeled "20" and a vertical line representing all the points with air temperature of "0".  These two cross when the wind speed is 15 mph. 
<!--end-answer-->
